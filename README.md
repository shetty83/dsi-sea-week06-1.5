## Introduction
It's finally time for us to migrate our website to our new server! This is a combined lesson / lab.

The lesson can be found in the file "Django Heroku Migration.ipynb".

In it we will:
* Create our new Virtual Environment
* Create our new Environment variables
* Deploy our creation to Heroku

The lab can be found in the file "Google Spreadsheets API.ipynb".

In it we will:
* Connect to our course grading spreadsheet
* Print out the spreadsheet's data on our site

## Exercise
